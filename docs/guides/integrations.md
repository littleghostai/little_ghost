# Connect interfaces and tracing

Send the same Run through an interactive interface and a tracing system without
changing the Agent that produced it. The AG-UI adapter translates Run events
for a client, while the OpenTelemetry subscriber publishes operational traces.

## Send a Run stream through AG-UI

The AG-UI adapter converts LittleGhost events into protocol event hashes:

```ruby
require "json"
require "little_ghost/ag_ui"

source = CustomerSupportAgent.stream_ask(
  question,
  actor_id: authenticated_user.id,
  context: {account_id: authenticated_user.account_id}
)

events = LittleGhost::AGUI::Adapter.new.stream(
  source,
  thread_id: conversation.id,
  run_id: request.request_id
)

events.each { |event| websocket.write(JSON.generate(event)) }
```

The adapter translates text, reasoning, Tool activity, usage, retries, trace
context, subagent activity, and terminal outcomes. It is stateless between
calls. Your application still owns the connection, backpressure, disconnect
behavior, and any request state its callbacks need.

LittleGhost also emits namespaced custom events. Consumers should preserve or
deliberately ignore event types they don't recognize. See the [AG-UI event
documentation](https://docs.ag-ui.com/concepts/events) when implementing the
client.

> **Safety note:** A Run stream can include model output, Tool arguments and
> results, errors, and participant activity. Check that the connected user may
> see the complete Run, then filter fields before sending or storing events.

Calling `each` drives the source stream on the caller's fiber or thread. When a
client disconnects, stop enumerating and apply the cancellation behavior your
application needs. Closing the socket can't undo Tool work that already ran.

## Trace Runs with OpenTelemetry

Configure an OpenTelemetry SDK and exporter in the application, then register
the LittleGhost subscriber before the first Agent call:

```ruby
LittleGhost.configure do |config|
  config.instrument LittleGhost::Tracing::OpenTelemetry.new
end
```

LittleGhost depends on `opentelemetry-api`, leaving the SDK, processor, and
exporter up to the application. It emits spans and events for Runs, Agents,
model calls, Tools, assemblies, sessions, usage, and failures. Active operations
can propagate W3C `traceparent` and `tracestate` fields.

Prompts, messages, responses, Tool arguments, and exception content are omitted
by default. If you intentionally need some of that content, install a
`LittleGhost::Support::ContentCapture` with a scrubber before enabling capture.
Avoid putting raw user, order, session, or request IDs in span attributes.

Attribute names follow the evolving [OpenTelemetry GenAI semantic
conventions](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/gen-ai/) where they
apply. Flush or shut down `LittleGhost::Instrumentation` during application
shutdown when your backend buffers data.

See [Running in Production](production.md) for startup, shutdown, and
observability, [MCP Tools](mcp.md) for operations published by remote servers,
and [Workspaces and Sandboxes](sandboxing.md) for child processes and files.
